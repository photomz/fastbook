We'll use one of the most famous datasets in computer vision, [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), for our experiments. MNIST contains images of handwritten digits, collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and collated into a machine learning dataset by Yann Lecun and his colleagues. Lecun used MNIST in 1998 in [Lenet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/), the first computer system to demonstrate practically useful recognition of handwritten digit sequences. This was one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of AI."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zGQW5xvVTmAJ"},"source":["## Sidebar: Tenacity and Deep Learning"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mJbIGdeMTmAJ"},"source":["The story of deep learning is one of tenacity and grit by a handful of dedicated researchers. After early hopes (and hype!) neural networks went out of favor in the 1990's and 2000's, and just a handful of researchers kept trying to make them work well. Three of them, Yann Lecun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton, were awarded the highest honor in computer science, the Turing Award (generally considered the \"Nobel Prize of computer science\"), in 2018 after triumphing despite the deep skepticism and disinterest of the wider machine learning and statistics community.\n","\n","Geoff Hinton has told of how even academic papers showing dramatically better results than anything previously published would be rejected by top journals and conferences, just because they used a neural network. Yann Lecun's work on convolutional neural networks, which we will study in the next section, showed that these models could read handwritten text—something that had never been achieved before. However, his breakthrough was ignored by most researchers, even as it was used commercially to read 10% of the checks in the US!\n","\n","In addition to these three Turing Award winners, there are many other researchers who have battled to get us to where we are today. For instance, Jurgen Schmidhuber (who many believe should have shared in the Turing Award) pioneered many important ideas, including working with his student Sepp Hochreiter on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (widely used for speech recognition and other text modeling tasks, and used in the IMDb example in <<chapter_intro>>). Perhaps most important of all, Paul Werbos in 1974 invented back-propagation for neural networks, the technique shown in this chapter and used universally for training neural networks ([Werbos 1994](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Roots_of_Backpropagation.html?id=WdR3OOM2gBwC)). His development was almost entirely ignored for decades, but today it is considered the most important foundation of modern AI.\n","\n","There is a lesson here for all of us! On your deep learning journey you will face many obstacles, both technical, and (even more difficult) posed by people around you who don't believe you'll be successful. There's one *guaranteed* way to fail, and that's to stop trying.

A list comprehension looks like this: `new_list = [f(o) for o in a_list if o>0]`. This will return every element of `a_list` that is greater than 0, after passing it to the function `f`.

Consider that we live in \"three-dimensonal space\" where a physical position can be described by a 3-vector `v`. But according to PyTorch, the attribute `v.ndim` (which sure looks like the \"number of dimensions\" of `v`) equals one, not three! Why? Because `v` is a vector, which is a tensor of rank one, meaning that it has only one _axis_ (even if that axis has a length of three). In other words, sometimes dimension is used for the size of an axis (\"space is three-dimensional\"); other times, it is used for the rank, or the number of axes (\"a matrix has two dimensions\").

But everybody forgets some things! It all depends on what you happen to have had reason to practice in the meantime. Perhaps you have forgotten what a _square root_ is, or exactly how they work. No problem! Any time you come across a maths concept that is not explained fully in this book, don't just keep moving on; instead, stop and look it up.

Since that can be any type at all, they can even be arrays of arrays, with the innermost arrays potentially being different sizes—this is called a \"jagged array.\" By \"multidimensional table\" we mean, for instance, a list (dimension of one), a table or matrix (dimension of two), a \"table of tables\" or \"cube\" (dimension of three), and so forth. If the items are all of some simple type such as integer or float, then NumPy will store them as a compact C data structure in memory. This is where NumPy shines. NumPy has a wide variety of operators and methods that can run computations on these compact structures at the same speed as optimized C, because they are written in optimized C.\n","\n","A PyTorch tensor is nearly the same thing as a NumPy array, but with an additional restriction that unlocks some additional capabilities. It's the same in that it, too, is a multidimensional table of data, with all items of the same type.

It is always a regularly shaped multidimensional rectangular structure.\n","\n","The vast majority of methods and operators supported by NumPy on these structures are also supported by PyTorch, but PyTorch tensors have additional capabilities. One major capability is that these structures can live on the GPU, in which case their computation will be optimized for the GPU and can run much faster (given lots of values to work on).

The last two axes are the horizontal and vertical dimensions of an image.

different ways to do each of these seven steps, and we will be learning about them throughout the rest of this book. These are the details that make a big difference for deep learning practitioners, but it turns out that the general approach to each one generally follows some basic principles. Here are a few guidelines:\n","\n","- Initialize:: We initialize the parameters to random values. This may sound surprising. There are certainly other choices we could make, such as initializing them to the percentage of times that pixel is activated for that category—but since we already know that we have a routine to improve these weights, it turns out that just starting with random weights works perfectly well.\n","- Loss:: This is what Samuel referred to when he spoke of *testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance*. We need some function that will return a number that is small if the performance of the model is good (the standard approach is to treat a small loss as good, and a large loss as bad, although this is just a convention).\n","- Step:: A simple way to figure out whether a weight should be increased a bit, or decreased a bit, would be just to try it: increase the weight by a small amount, and see if the loss goes up or down. Once you find the correct direction, you could then change that amount by a bit more, and a bit less, until you find an amount that works well. However, this is slow! As we will see, the magic of calculus allows us to directly figure out in which direction, and by roughly how much, to change each weight, without having to try all these small changes. The way to do this is by calculating *gradients*. This is just a performance optimization, we would get exactly the same results by using the slower manual process as well.\n","- Stop:: Once we've decided how many epochs to train the model for (a few suggestions for this were given in the earlier list), we apply that decision. This is where that decision is applied. For our digit classifier, we would keep training until the accuracy of the model started getting worse, or we ran out of time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G_7Y8DvCTmAU"},"source":["Before applying these steps to our image classification problem, let's illustrate what they look like in a simpler case.

As we mentioned, we use calculus as a performance optimization; it allows us to more quickly calculate whether our loss will go up or down when we adjust our parameters up or down. In other words, the gradients will tell us how much we have to change each weight to make our model better.\n","\n","You may remember from your high school calculus class that the *derivative* of a function tells you how much a change in its parameters will change its result. If not, don't worry, lots of us forget calculus once high school is behind us! But you will have to have some intuitive understanding of what a derivative is before you continue, so if this is all very fuzzy in your head, head over to Khan Academy and complete the [lessons on basic derivatives](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus/dc-diff-intro). You won't have to know how to calculate them yourselves, you just have to know what a derivative is.\n","\n","The key point about a derivative is this: for any function, such as the quadratic function we saw in the previous section, we can calculate its derivative. The derivative is another function. It calculates the change, rather than the value. For instance, the derivative of the quadratic function at the value 3 tells us how rapidly the function changes at the value 3. More specifically, you may recall that gradient is defined as *rise/run*, that is, the change in the value of the function, divided by the change in the value of the parameter. When we know how our function will change, then we know what we need to do to make it smaller. This is the key to machine learning: having a way to change the parameters of a function to make it smaller. Calculus provides us with a computational shortcut, the derivative, which lets us directly calculate the gradients of our functions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SjSurSRWTmAV"},"source":["One important thing to be aware of is that our function has lots of weights that we need to adjust, so when we calculate the derivative we won't get back one number, but lots of them—a gradient for every weight. But there is nothing mathematically tricky here; you can calculate the derivative with respect to one weight, and treat all the other ones as constant, then repeat that for each other weight. This is how all of the gradients are calculated, for every weight.\n","\n","We mentioned just now that you won't have to calculate any gradients yourself. How can that be? Amazingly enough, PyTorch is able to automatically compute the derivative of nearly any function! What's more, it does it very fast.

In those contexts the \"gradient\" of a function is just another function (i.e., its derivative), so you might expect gradient-related APIs to give you a new function. But in deep learning, \"gradients\" usually means the _value_ of a function's derivative at a particular argument value. The PyTorch API also puts the focus on the argument, not the function you're actually computing the gradients of. It may feel backwards at first, but it's just a different perspective.\n","\n","Now we calculate our function with that value.

Nearly all approaches start with the basic idea of multiplying the gradient by some small number, called the *learning rate* (LR). The learning rate is often a number between 0.001 and 0.1, although it could be anything. Often, people select a learning rate just by trying a few, and finding which results in the best model after training (we'll show you a better approach later in this book, called the *learning rate finder*). Once you've picked a learning rate, you can adjust your parameters using this simple function:\n","\n","```\n","w -= gradient(w) * lr\n","```\n","\n","This is known as *stepping* your parameters, using an *optimizer step*. Notice how we _subtract_ the `gradient * lr` from the parameter to update it.  This allows us to adjust the parameter in the direction of the slope by increasing the parameter when the slope is negative and decreasing the parameter when the slope is positive.  We want to adjust our parameters in the direction of the slope because our goal in deep learning is to _minimize_ the loss.\n","\n","If you pick a learning rate that's too low, it can mean having to do a lot of steps. <<descent_small>> illustrates that."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3PHGdwlUTmAW"},"source":["<img alt=\"An illustration of gradient descent with a LR too low\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Gradient descent with low LR\" src=\"images/chapter2_small.svg\" id=\"descent_small\"/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ij9bLmCGTmAW"},"source":["But picking a learning rate that's too high is even worse—it can actually result in the loss getting *worse*, as we see in <<descent_div>>!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m7tBGHFRTmAW"},"source":["<img alt=\"An illustration of gradient descent with a LR too high\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Gradient descent with high LR\" src=\"images/chapter2_div.svg\" id=\"descent_div\"/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EskWdLQWTmAW"},"source":["If the learning rate is too high, it may also \"bounce\" around, rather than actually diverging; <<descent_bouncy>> shows how this has the result of taking many steps to train successfully."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9SV8dND2TmAW"},"source":["<img alt=\"An illustation of gradient descent with a bouncy LR\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Gradient descent with bouncy LR\" src=\"images/chapter2_bouncy.svg\" id=\"descent_bouncy\"/>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x9xQyM6VTmAW"},"source":["Now let's apply all of this in an end-to-end example."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UI0shfFxTmAW"},"source":["### An End-to-End SGD Example"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eJ_F7N8KTmAW"},"source":["We've seen how to use gradients to find a minimum.

beginning, the weights of our model can be random (training *from scratch*) or come from a pretrained model (*transfer learning*). In the first case, the output we will get from our inputs won't have anything to do with what we want, and even in the second case, it's very likely the pretrained model won't be very good at the specific task we are targeting. So the model will need to *learn* better weights.\n","\n","We begin by comparing the outputs the model gives us with our targets (we have labeled data, so we know what result the model should give) using a *loss function*, which returns a number that we want to make as low as possible by improving our weights. To do this, we take a few data items (such as images) from the training set and feed them to our model. We compare the corresponding targets using our loss function, and the score we get tells us how wrong our predictions were. We then change the weights a little bit to make it slightly better.\n","\n","To find how to change the weights to make the loss a bit better, we use calculus to calculate the *gradients*. (Actually, we let PyTorch do it for us!) Let's consider an analogy. Imagine you are lost in the mountains with your car parked at the lowest point. To find your way back to it, you might wander in a random direction, but that probably wouldn't help much. Since you know your vehicle is at the lowest point, you would be better off going downhill. By always taking a step in the direction of the steepest downward slope, you should eventually arrive at your destination. We use the magnitude of the gradient (i.e., the steepness of the slope) to tell us how big a step to take; specifically, we multiply the gradient by a number we choose called the *learning rate* to decide on the step size. We then *iterate* until we have reached the lowest point, which will be our parking lot, then we can *stop*.\n","\n","All of that we just saw can be transposed directly to the MNIST dataset, except for the loss function.

The obvious approach would be to use accuracy, which is our metric, as our loss function as well. In this case, we would calculate our prediction for each image, collect these values to calculate an overall accuracy, and then calculate the gradients of each weight with respect to that overall accuracy.\n","\n","Unfortunately, we have a significant technical problem here. The gradient of a function is its *slope*, or its steepness, which can be defined as *rise over run*—that is, how much the value of the function goes up or down, divided by how much we changed the input. We can write this in mathematically as: `(y_new - y_old) / (x_new - x_old)`. This gives us a good approximation of the gradient when `x_new` is very similar to `x_old`, meaning that their difference is very small. But accuracy only changes at all when a prediction changes from a 3 to a 7, or vice versa. The problem is that a small change in weights from `x_old` to `x_new` isn't likely to cause any prediction to change, so `(y_new - y_old)` will almost always be 0.

This then gives gradients that are 0 or infinite, which are useless for updating the model.\n","\n","Instead, we need a loss function which, when our weights result in slightly better predictions, gives us a slightly better loss. So what does a \"slightly better prediction\" look like, exactly?

After all, we already had a metric, which was overall accuracy. So why did we define a loss?\n","\n","The key difference is that the metric is to drive human understanding and the loss is to drive automated learning. To drive automated learning, the loss must be a function that has a meaningful derivative. It can't have big flat sections and large jumps, but instead must be reasonably smooth. This is why we designed a loss function that would respond to small changes in confidence level. This requirement means that sometimes it does not really reflect exactly what we are trying to achieve, but is rather a compromise between our real goal and a function that can be optimized using its gradient. The loss function is calculated for each item in our dataset, and then at the end of an epoch the loss values are all averaged and the overall mean is reported for the epoch.\n","\n","Metrics, on the other hand, are the numbers that we really care about. These are the values that are printed at the end of each epoch that tell us how our model is really doing. It is important that we learn to focus on these metrics, rather than the loss, when judging the performance of a model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XheK8qdSTmAd"},"source":["### SGD and Mini-Batches"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wy-Rr3xjTmAd"},"source":["Now that we have a loss function that is suitable for driving SGD, we can consider some of the details involved in the next phase of the learning process, which is to change or update the weights based on the gradients. This is called an *optimization step*.\n","\n","In order to take an optimization step we need to calculate the loss over one or more data items. How many should we use? We could calculate it for the whole dataset, and take the average, or we could calculate it for a single data item. But neither of these is ideal. Calculating it for the whole dataset would take a very long time. Calculating it for a single item would not use much information, so it would result in a very imprecise and unstable gradient. That is, you'd be going to the trouble of updating the weights, but taking into account only how that would improve the model's performance on that single item.\n","\n","So instead we take a compromise between the two: we calculate the average loss for a few data items at a time. This is called a *mini-batch*. The number of data items in the mini-batch is called the *batch size*. A larger batch size means that you will get a more accurate and stable estimate of your dataset's gradients from the loss function, but it will take longer, and you will process fewer mini-batches per epoch. Choosing a good batch size is one of the decisions you need to make as a deep learning practitioner to train your model quickly and accurately. We will talk about how to make this choice throughout this book.\n","\n","Another good reason for using mini-batches rather than calculating the gradient on individual data items is that, in practice, we nearly always do our training on an accelerator such as a GPU. These accelerators only perform well if they have lots of work to do at a time, so it's helpful if we can give them lots of data items to work on. Using mini-batches is one of the best ways to do this. However, if you give them too much data to work on at once, they run out of memory—making GPUs happy is also tricky!\n","\n","As we saw in our discussion of data augmentation in <<chapter_production>>, we get better generalization if we can vary things during training. One simple and effective thing we can vary is what data items we put in each mini-batch. Rather than simply enumerating our dataset in order for every epoch, instead what we normally do is randomly shuffle it on every epoch, before we create mini-batches. PyTorch and fastai provide a class that will do the shuffling and mini-batch collation for you, called `DataLoader`.\n","\n","A `DataLoader` can take any Python collection and turn it into an iterator over mini-batches, like so:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":95,"metadata":{"id":"_A5q8VsqTmAe","outputId":"31b59c71-fc50-4722-e6bf-30175973fd8b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677592937825,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Markus Zhang","userId":"14480156930469636023"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[tensor([ 3, 12,  8, 10,  2]),\n"," tensor([ 9,  4,  7, 14,  5]),\n"," tensor([ 1, 13,  0,  6, 11])]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":95}],"source":["coll = range(15)\n","dl = DataLoader(coll, batch_size=5, shuffle=True)\n","list(dl)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J6TWpmLoTmAe"},"source":["For training a model, we don't just want any Python collection, but a collection containing independent and dependent variables (that is, the inputs and targets of the model).

J: There is an enormous amount of jargon in deep learning, including terms like _rectified linear unit_. The vast vast majority of this jargon is no more complicated than can be implemented in a short line of code, as we saw in this example. The reality is that for academics to get their papers published they need to make them sound as impressive and sophisticated as possible. One of the ways that they do that is to introduce jargon. Unfortunately, this has the result that the field ends up becoming far more intimidating and difficult to get into than it should be. You do have to learn the jargon, because otherwise papers and tutorials are not going to mean much to you. But that doesn't mean you have to find the jargon intimidating. Just remember, when you come across a word or phrase that you haven't seen before, it will almost certainly turn out to be referring to a very simple concept."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E-kmgQwzTmAl"},"source":["The basic idea is that by using more linear layers, we can have our model do more computation, and therefore model more complex functions. But there's no point just putting one linear layer directly after another one, because when we multiply things together and then add them up multiple times, that could be replaced by multiplying different things together and adding them up just once! That is to say, a series of any number of linear layers in a row can be replaced with a single linear layer with a different set of parameters.\n","\n","But if we put a nonlinear function between them, such as `max`, then this is no longer true. Now each linear layer is actually somewhat decoupled from the other ones, and can do its own useful work. The `max` function is particularly interesting, because it operates as a simple `if` statement."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jCych9kpTmAl"},"source":["> S: Mathematically, we say the composition of two linear functions is another linear function.

For any arbitrarily wiggly function, we can approximate it as a bunch of lines joined together; to make it closer to the wiggly function, we just have to use shorter lines. This is known as the *universal approximation theorem*. The three lines of code that we have here are known as *layers*. The first and third are known as *linear layers*, and the second line of code is known variously as a *nonlinearity*, or *activation function*.\n","\n","Just like in the previous section, we can replace this code with something a bit simpler, by taking advantage of PyTorch:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":132,"metadata":{"id":"Hn72bPN3TmAl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677592949579,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Markus Zhang","userId":"14480156930469636023"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["simple_net = nn.Sequential(\n","    nn.Linear(28*28,30),\n","    nn.ReLU(),\n","    nn.Linear(30,1)\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Phhqepw2TmAm"},"source":["`nn.Sequential` creates a module that will call each of the listed layers or functions in turn.\n","\n","`nn.ReLU` is a PyTorch module that does exactly the same thing as the `F.relu` function. Most functions that can appear in a model also have identical forms that are modules. Generally, it's just a case of replacing `F` with `nn` and changing the capitalization. When using `nn.Sequential`, PyTorch requires us to use the module version. Since modules are classes, we have to instantiate them, which is why you see `nn.ReLU()` in this example. \n","\n","Because `nn.Sequential` is a module, we can get its parameters, which will return a list of all the parameters of all the modules it contains.

Believing that this combination of simple techniques can really solve any problem is one of the biggest steps that we find many students have to take. It seems too good to be true—surely things should be more difficult and complicated than this? Our recommendation: try it out! We just tried it on the MNIST dataset and you have seen the results.

We can add as many as we want, as long as we add a nonlinearity between each pair of linear layers. As you will learn, however, the deeper the model gets, the harder it is to optimize the parameters in practice. Later in this book you will learn about some simple but brilliantly effective techniques for training deeper models.\n","\n","We already know that a single nonlinearity with two linear layers is enough to approximate any function. So why would we use deeper models? The reason is performance. With a deeper model (that is, one with more layers) we do not need to use as many parameters; it turns out that we can use smaller matrices with more layers, and get better results than we would get with larger matrices, and few layers.\n","\n","That means that we can train the model more quickly, and it will take up less memory. In the 1990s researchers were so focused on the universal approximation theorem that very few were experimenting with more than one nonlinearity. This theoretical but not practical foundation held back the field for years. Some researchers, however, did experiment with deep models, and eventually were able to show that these models could perform much better in practice.
